# How will ChatGPT improve software development?

### To the hype and beyond

Everybody talks about the possibilities we will have by integrating ChatGPT into different parts of our digital world. I want to share with you a better-informed opinion from someone I trust, that understands what are the implications and some of the practical use cases in the software development field.

### The opinion

There are several ways that ChatGPT, or other large language models like it, could potentially be used to help software developers and revolutionize software development:

1. Code completion: ChatGPT or similar models could be used to build intelligent code completion tools that can suggest code snippets or entire blocks of code based on the context of the current project. This could save developers a lot of time and effort, and reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs by typing out code manually.
    
2. API suggestion: ChatGPT or similar models could be used to suggest appropriate APIs or libraries for a given task based on the context of the project and the desired functionality. This could save developers time by eliminating the need to manually search for and evaluate potential APIs.
    
3. Bug prediction: ChatGPT or similar models could be used to analyze code and predict the likelihood of certain bugs occurring, based on code patterns and other similar projects. This could help developers prioritize their debugging efforts and potentially prevent bugs from being introduced in the first place.
    
4. Automatic documentation generation: ChatGPT or similar models could be used to automatically generate technical documentation based on the code and comments in a project. This could save developers time by eliminating the need to write documentation manually, and ensure that documentation is always up to date with the code.
    

Overall, the use of large language models like ChatGPT can greatly increase the efficiency and productivity of software development and improve the quality of the software being developed.

### Do you agree with the above opinion?

Well..., I just asked ChatGPT:

> What can ChatGPT do for software developers to help at work and to revolutionize software development?

Believe it or not, the above is the original response ðŸ˜®. Pure madness!

### What future will be like in software development?

I don't know, but this tool is extremely powerful. I played with it in different contexts, from generating generic high-level code to explaining algorithms for puzzles, and I see a lot of revolutionary ideas that will use this in not so distant future. Anyway, from time to time, I will use it for my software development work to find new features and test the boundaries. [Give it a try](https://chat.openai.com/chat). Cheers!
